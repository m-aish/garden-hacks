# Garden Cook
A lot of people tend to prefer buying their vegetables than growing them due to space and monetary constraints. Garden Cook was made to quantify the amount of money you save by growing edible plants. Garden Cook will receive input of all the vegetables, plants and spices that are grown in your garden and suggest recipes based on them to minimise the amount of money you spend on grocery shopping.
